Onion Architecture: (Yes/No)

Have you heard of the Onion Architecture principle in software design?

Yes, I'm familiar with the Onion Architecture principle in software design. It emphasizes a layered approach where the core logic and business rules are kept at the center, surrounded by layers that handle different concerns such as data access, user interface, and external services.

MVC Pattern: (Yes/No)

Are you familiar with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for building web applications?


Yes, I'm familiar with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern used for building web applications. It divides an application into three interconnected components, the Model, which manages the data and business logic, the View, which handles the user interface and presentation, and the Controller, which processes user input and interacts with the Model and View. However, I'm not sure how to program using the MVC pattern because I lack the prerequisite knowledge of the specific programming language required for its implementation.


Web API: (Yes/No)

Do you understand the concept of building RESTful APIs using ASP.NET Core Web API?

-No //

Application & Bottlenecks: Onion Architecture:

Benefits: (1-3 keywords)

Codependent
Uniform
Organized
Briefly list some key benefits of using Onion Architecture in .NET Core projects. (e.g., separation of concerns, testability)

Dividing the functions through different layers allows the architecture to have a systematic and methodical approach to providing outputs.
Isolation of modules allows for a more comprehensive way of detecting issues and weaknesses within the infrastructure, by doing so you can isolate the problem without affecting the other layers' individual roles.
Bottlenecks (Encountered): (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)

Have you encountered any challenges with Onion Architecture in your projects? If so, briefly describe the bottleneck(s). (e.g., Increased complexity for simple projects, difficulty finding developers familiar with the pattern)

Yes, I've faced challenges with Onion Architecture in my projects. I lacked the necessary information, so I ended up piecing together various tutorials for different functions. This resulted in an amalgamation of overlapping techniques, making the project a jumbled mix rather than a coherent structure.

MVC:
Components: (1-3 keywords each)

Model, View, Controller

Briefly describe the roles of the Model, View, and Controller in the MVC pattern.

Model: It manages the data, logic, and rules of the application's domain. 
View: Is responsible for presenting the data to the user. 
Controller: Acts as an intermediary between the model and the view.

Bottlenecks (Encountered): (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)

Have you encountered any challenges with tight coupling between Model and Controller in MVC projects? If so, briefly describe the issue(s). (e.g., Difficulty in unit testing controllers, logic changes rippling through the application)

Yes, I've encountered challenges with tight coupling between the Model and Controller in MVC projects. The main issue is that I don't have a thorough understanding of the structure to effectively connect them. This lack of clarity makes it difficult to separate concerns properly.

Web API:

Differences from MVC: (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)

Can you differentiate between traditional MVC applications and Web APIs? Briefly explain the main difference.

I'm not sure of the main difference because I don't fully understand how traditional MVC applications look and operate. However, I do know that Web APIs work like a black box, where users request specific outputs, and the API returns the requested data.

Bottlenecks (Encountered): (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)

Have you encountered any performance challenges with traditional MVC applications compared to Web APIs? If so, briefly describe the scenario(s). (e.g., Frequent page refreshes causing performance overhead, complex data exchange requiring a more lightweight approach)

The main challenge I encountered with traditional MVC applications was installing all the necessary dependencies for the project. Similarly, with Web APIs, I faced difficulties with dependencies and didn't have experience troubleshooting them. To address compatibility issues, I attempted to lower the version of some dependencies to ensure they would work together.
